Simple fan game based on `The Binding of Isaac (TBOI)`. Created as a brief reminder of how to work with `<canvas>`.

## Stack

## Getting Started
To run the application, make sure you have `Docker` and `Node.js` installed on your machine.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-fan-game.git
cd simple-fan-game
```

Install dependencies:

npm install
```

Start the application using Docker Compose:
```bash
